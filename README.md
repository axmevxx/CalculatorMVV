# My First Project: Back to Coding

This is **my project** after a long hiatus, and I'm giving programming another go. Feeling a mix of excitement and a bit of nerves, but thrilled to be getting back into coding.

## What's this project all about?
For now, I've decided to kick off with something straightforward so that I can progressively tackle more complex tasks.

## Why am I doing this?
- I want to reacquaint myself with the skills that once felt second nature to me.
- I'm keen to discover how much I'm still capable of learning and growing.

## What's on the horizon?
- I plan to keep plugging away at this project, enhancing it and introducing new features.
- I'm hopeful that this project will aid me in reviving my programming abilities and spark fresh ideas.
